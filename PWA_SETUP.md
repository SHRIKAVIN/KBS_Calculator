# 🚀 PWA Setup Guide for KBS Calculator

Your KBS Calculator app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's how to complete the setup:

## ✨ What's Already Done

- ✅ PWA manifest file (`public/manifest.json`)
- ✅ Service worker (`public/sw.js`)
- ✅ PWA meta tags in HTML
- ✅ Install prompt component
- ✅ Icon generation script

## 🖼️ Step 1: Add Your Calculator Image

1. **Save your calculator image** (the one from the screenshot) to the `public/` folder
2. **Rename it** to `calculator-icon.png`
3. **Ensure it's** in PNG format and at least 512x512 pixels

## 🎨 Step 2: Generate PWA Icons

Run the icon generation script:

```bash
node scripts/generate-icons.js
```

This will create:
- `icon-192x192.png` - Standard PWA icon
- `icon-512x512.png` - Large PWA icon
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS app icon

## 📱 Step 3: Test PWA Installation
